# Game instructions

This is my take on the classic computer game 'SNAKE'. The main objective of the game is to collect as many of the glowing 'apples' and special tiles as you can without crossing your own tail or crashing into the boundary of the grid. The more your snake eats the longer and faster it becomes, making the game increasingly difficult.

I added the option to play the game with two players. In this mode one player controls their snake using the arrow keys, while the other makes use of the WASD keys. Users can still collect apples to grow their snake but the speed is constant. The winner is the player who manages to avoid crashing into themselves, the other user, or the walls the longest.
